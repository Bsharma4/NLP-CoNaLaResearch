# NLP-CoNaLaResearch
 The Code/Natural Language Challenge(CoNaLa), a collaboration between the Carnegie Mellon University NeuLab and STRUDEL Lab, served as the inspiration and guideline for this individual research project. The focus of this research was implementing a Machine translation model and achieving best BLEU score for the CoNaLa challenge dataset.

Our evaluations follow using english text intent and target python language snippets to train a Encoder-Decoder state-of-the-art Machine Translation Model. The code and resources are available at \hyperlink{https://github.com/conala-corpus/conala-baseline/}{Conala Baseline}
